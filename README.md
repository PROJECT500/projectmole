# PROJECT: MOLE
A discord bot made to help those with OSDD/DID. <b><u>Made by a system, for systems.</u></b>

My bot is a self help bot for new alters / alters out of dormancy to help ground them by telling them where they are with a breif explanation of what a system is and why they are there. 

MOLE stands for - Multiple Others Learning Eachother, and the mascot is a mole because the bot wants to help you "not turn these mole hills into mountains" 

This is a work in progress, and probably wont be done for a while as this is the first ever bot I have ever done. 

<b><u>You can add the bot here:</b></u> https://tinylink.net/nw32m <br> :) it's in its early stages so please be kind with it! 
and please make sure to submit an issue in the issue tab if you come across any bugs!
