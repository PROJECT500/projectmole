# PROJECT: MOLE
A discord bot made to help those with OSDD/DID. Made by a system, for systems.

My bot is a self help bot for new alters / alters out of dormancy to help ground them by telling them where they are (server wise) date&time and a breif explanation of what a system is and why they are there. 

Mole stands for - Multiple Others Learning Eachother, and the mascot is a mole because the bot wants to help you "not turn these mole hills into mountains" 

This is a work in progress, and probably wont be done for a while as this is the first ever bot I have ever done. 

You can add the bot here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766312876272648213&scope=bot&permissions=2105015551 :) it's in its early stages so please be kind with it!
